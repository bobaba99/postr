# Fix plan — approved 2026-09-27

Readable version: https://claude.ai/artifact/Uip1hzXaK9ssopFvzwH755 (owner-private).
Every number below was measured in the 2026-09-27 planning round (real editor
in Chromium with the backend faked at the network layer; real matplotlib
3.10.8; Rscript 4.6.0 + ggplot2 4.0.3). Harnesses are committed with the fix
they prove.

**Per-fix process (owner's rule):** reproduce from the user's entry point ->
root cause (check shared causes) -> fix -> falsify (revert, test goes red) ->
review #1 -> address -> review #2 on the updated fix -> address -> commit ->
merge. One branch per cause.

## Owner decisions

- Poster-size wipe goes before the 13-inch fit problem.
- Changing poster size asks first, then moves existing blocks onto the new sheet.
- Guidelines panel starts closed on small screens.
- Undo is PowerPoint-style: one history, works inside text, large changes too.
- A pasted plot script survives a reload.
- Owner check: undo of deleted text/components works in real Chrome. Redo
  after undoing typing is still unconfirmed (settled by item 12).

## Assumptions accepted with the plan

- Poster gutter 64 px (smallest measured value with no handles under rulers).
- "Small screen" = viewport narrower than 1600 px.
- Pasted script saved per poster in this browser (localStorage), not in the poster.
- Undo history 50 -> 100 steps.

## Order

| # | Fix | Effect | Size | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A sidebar change wipes the undo history | loses work | S-M | new |
| 2 | A new poster size replaces the whole poster | loses work | M | new |
| 3 | Fit leaves the far edge cut off (36 px, 64/64 configs) | looks broken | S | F5 |
| 4 | Rulers off by up to 30 in | wrong result | S | new |
| 5 | Printing from Preview runs the title into the authors (up to 1.9 in) | wrong result | S | O1, O3 |
| 6 | Group move/resize can't be undone | looks broken | S | F1 |
| 7 | Leaving the Figure tab loses the pasted script; must survive reload | loses work | M | FR9 |
| 8 | A failed save is treated as saved | loses work | M | F7c |
| 9 | Error screens show DB text, no way out | dead end | S-M | F7a/b/e/f |
| 10 | Crash screen claims "work is safe" when it may not be | wrong result | S | F7g |
| 11 | Losing the session mid-edit closes the editor | loses work | L | F7d |
| 12 | PowerPoint-style undo (text undo goes to the browser today) | looks broken | L | F2 |
| 13 | Checker can't read its own Python fix; per-element rcParams ignored (re-lands 1.0x ticks) | wrong result | M | W1, W2 |
| 14 | seaborn contexts / style sheets misread | wrong result | M | W3 |
| 15 | Check does nothing when it can't tell R from Python (re-lands detection) | dead end | S-M | W4 |
| 16 | R fix attached to print(p) passes but changes nothing | wrong result | M | new |
| 17 | "Copied" on failure, empty Scan image, stale language label | annoyance | S | W4 siblings |
| 18 | Run every corrected script in real R and Python | prevents repeats | M | new |

## Checked and retired

- F8 "text clipped in print": 0 of 14 blocks clipped. Only content past the sheet
  bottom is cut, and ISSUES already warns.
- F5 "a whole column hidden": no; 21% of one column, a constant 36 px.
